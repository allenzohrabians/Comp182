Comp 182/L Spring 2019 P3 Allen Zohrabians 83 = 78 + 5 ec Notes: ? results: create insert good, delete wrong. How can you delete half the nodes in the tree and then have a tree with average height that is 8 times larger. The average height after deletion should be less. ? analysis: no comparison with theoretical height results for fully balanced BST. = insert and delete have recursive call, but a correct recursive insert or delete would return a BSTNode on return calls - insert does no delete correctly for power 4 tree has less than 15 nodes; depending on shuffle - delete does not delete correctly - BSTElement value is int not Integer - no verify() # name in header comment all source files # use of named constants (not hard coded constants) # compile # execute # generic <E> == BSTElement Classes: # BSTree<E>, # BSTNode<E>, # BSTElement, # Sample # BSTP3 (main) ? max height ? average height # BSTree # create 2^10 -1 # delete 10^9 -1 # re-insert 10^8 -1 # shuffle ?
